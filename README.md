Redbus Data Scraping with Selenium & Dynamic Filtering using Streamlit


The Redbus Data Scraping project is designed to automate the extraction of bus route and schedule data from the Redbus website. This data is then stored in an SQLite database and made accessible through a Streamlit web application. The Streamlit app provides dynamic filtering and visualization tools, enabling users to easily explore and analyze the bus schedule data. This project aims to streamline data extraction and offer a user-friendly interface for efficient data exploration.


Web Scraping: Scrapes bus route details from the Redbus website. Data Storage: Stores scraped data in a MySQL database. Streamlit Application: Allows dynamic filtering and visualization of bus route data. Downloadable Reports: Users can download filtered data as CSV files.


Tools and Technologies: Python: For scripting and data manipulation. Selenium: For web scraping. MySQL: For data storage. Streamlit: For creating the web application. Pandas: For data handling and analysis. SQLAlchemy: For database connection and interaction.



Future Work: Improve data scraping to handle more complex scenarios. Add additional filtering options in the Streamlit application. Enhance the user interface for better user experience.



Results: Successfully scraped bus route details from Redbus and stored them in a MySQL database. Developed a Streamlit application for filtering and viewing the scraped data.
