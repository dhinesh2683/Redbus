Redbus Data Scraping with Selenium & Dynamic Filtering using Streamlit


This project involves scraping data from the Redbus website using Selenium, storing the scraped data in an SQLite database, and developing a Streamlit application to dynamically filter and display the data. The goal is to automate the data extraction process and provide a user-friendly interface for data exploration.



Web Scraping: Scrapes bus route details from the Redbus website.
Data Storage: Stores scraped data in a MySQL database.
Streamlit Application: Allows dynamic filtering and visualization of bus route data.
Downloadable Reports: Users can download filtered data as CSV files.


Tools and Technologies:
  Python: For scripting and data manipulation.
  Selenium: For web scraping.
  MySQL: For data storage.
  Streamlit: For creating the web application.
  Pandas: For data handling and analysis.
  SQLAlchemy: For database connection and interaction.


Future Work:
  Improve data scraping to handle more complex scenarios.
  Add additional filtering options in the Streamlit application.
  Enhance the user interface for better user experience.


Results:
  Successfully scraped bus route details from Redbus and stored them in a MySQL database.
  Developed a Streamlit application for filtering and viewing the scraped data.
